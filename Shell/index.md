title: The Unix Shell
---
The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive.
It has survived so long because it's a power tool
that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes.
More importantly,
it helps them combine existing programs in new ways
and automate repetitive tasks
so that they don't have to type the same things over and over again.
